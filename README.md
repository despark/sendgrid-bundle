# Send Grid Bundle
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/despark/sendgrid-bundle.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/despark/sendgrid-bundle)

Pretty simple bundle to wrap the main sendgrid as a service and expose
all of the configurations

---
Possibly we'll made a wrapper around the send grid sdk and make it
connected with interoperable mailer interface.
